# BIFROST_BRIDGES
I worked on a bunch of different mechanics on the game "Bifrost: Through The Realms", but here I wanted to show the work I did on the C++ for Bridges.

In the game each level consists of two realms. You can freely place a bridge to swap between those realms similarly to the time swapping from the Effect and Cause level in Titanfall 2. To do this I used a system of certain objects that would be in the exact same location in both realms such as a point on the floor, and then change your position relative to that point in both dimensions.

This was coded almost entirely in C++, and you can see my work in these two files for the bridges and dim pins.
