# March Madness Machine Learning
March Madness refers to two massive college basektball tournaments held in the US every year.

Every year my family runs a big competition to see who can predict the winners of the tournament the best, and it gets very competitive. I made this Program to try to use machine learning to predict the winners of each game using data on all of the teams from the previous 15+ years.

For the program I used Python's NumPy.
